== Glossary of terms

This glossary includes definitions of terms specific to RISC-V in addition to terms that are useful in understanding the architectures and technologies in use by RISC-V contributors and users.

ABI:: Application binary interface. Absctracts and interface for applications to not need to know what lies beneath it in S or M modes.
//(This definition contains ambiguities for people who are not familiar with where S and M modes operate).

AEE:: Application execution environment--the environment, from bare metal to full operating system, in which an application runs.

AIA:: xxx

AIS 31:: Information Security service for Europe and the global finance industry (for bank cards), written by BSI.

ALU:: Arithmetic Logical Unit

ASIC:: Application-Specific Integrated Circuit

AT:: xxx

ATA:: Advanced Technology Attachment

ATM:: Asynchronous Transfer Mode

Atomic Layer Deposition:: A layer-by-layer process that results in the deposition of thin films one atomic layer at a time in a highly controlled manner.

ATX:: Advanced Technology eXtended

BF:: Refers to Brain Float or Brain Floating Point, used in BFLOAT16.

BFLOAT16:: Brain floating point 16 bit--a vector (V) extension representing a wide dynamic range of numeric values by using a floating radix point.  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bfloat16_floating-point_format.

BSI:: German Federal Information Security service.

CPL:: Cost Per Load.

CPU Cache:: Many CPUs three kinds of caches to speed up data retrieval: an instruction cache for executable instruction fetch, a data cache for data store and fetch, and a translation lookaside buffer (TLB) for virtual-to-physical address translation for executable instructions and data.

CMOS:: Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor.

Chemical Vapor Deposition:: A chemical deposition process in which the wafer is exposed to one or more volatile precursors, which react and/or decompose on the substrate surface to produce the desired film.

DRAM:: Dynamic Random Access Memory.

eDRAM:: Embedded DRAM.

ELEN:: Element length.

Flip-flop:: Electronic circuitry with two stable states for use in storing binary data. Data stored in flip-flops is changed by applying specific inputs. Both flip-flops and latches are building blocks that are used in digital computing.

GE:: Gate Equivalent.

Hart:: Hardware Thread--at machine-mode level each hart is a real hardware thread, either one hart per core without hardware multithreading, or multiple harts per core with hardware multithreading, and 'hart' represents the hardware resource. It is possible to emulate harts in software, for example, privileged execution environments can multiplex lesser-privileged harts onto physical hardware using timer interrupts. Note that co-operative multithreading within the same privilege level is not a compliant implementation. Across all implementation choices, we retain the concept of a hart as a resource abstraction representing an independently advancing RISC-V execution context within a RISC-V execution environment.

IC:: Integrated Circuit.

IRC::  The IRC https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2812[Internet Relay Chat] protocol is for use with text based conferencing; the simplest client being any socket program capable of connecting to the server.

IIRC:: The International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) (previously the International Integrated Reporting Committee). was formed in August 2010 and aims to create a globally accepted framework for a process that results in communications by an organisation about value creation over time.

IMSIC:: (Instruction Memory Set ? ?)

Instruction Set:: A group of commands for a CPU in machine language that can refer to all possible instructions for a CPU, or a subset of instructions to enhance its performance in specific situations, and includes:
* Instruction length--which can vary, Opcodes--the command to be carried out.
* Operands--on which the command will operate.
* Registers--internal locations that are limited in number and ability while quick to access.
* Memory--external storage--a larger and more versatile number of locations that are slower to access.

ISA:: Instruction Set Architecture.

Latch:: A circuit that has two stable states that is used to store state information, known as a bistable multivibrator.

MCM:: Multi-Chip Module.

MMU:: Memory Management Unit.

NAND:: Not-and.

NIST:: Keeps the standard time for America, defines 1 inch, and also cryptographic standards.

Non-Standard Extension:: mmmm

NOR:: Logical NOR, known as Pierce's Equivalent, Quine's Dagger, the ampcheck (from the Greek for "cutting both ways"),  joint denial, or neither-nor, operates on two logical values, typically from two propositions, that produces a value of true if and only if both operands are false. In other words, it produces a value of false if and only if at least one operand is true.

Photolithography:: In microprocessor maufacturing, a process of using light to transfer a geometric pattern from a photomask (also called an optical mask) pattern parts to a photosensitive substrate on a thin film (substrate or wafer). The process can also make use of chemical photoresist on the substrate.

Platform:: A System Platform is a set of features users can depend on working together that includes things like ISA Profiles, software components, hardware system components, standardized hardware/software interfaces, and other features. Currently RISC-V has defined two Platform types--OS/A and M (naming TBD).

PLIC:: Progressive Lossless Image Coding.

PQC:: Post-Quantum Cryptography, due to replace RSA and ECC in NIST cryptography [PQC] as well as military [NSA].

Privileged:: mmmm

Profile:: An ISA Profile is set of extensions (instructions, state and behaviors) that users can depend on working together. Extensions are either required, optional, unsupported, or incompatible. RISC-V has defined two Profile types: Application (RVAyy)--appropriate for Linux-class and other embedded designs with more sophisticated ISA needs--and Microcontroller (RVMyy)--appropriate for cost-sensitive application-optimized embedded designs running bare-metal or simple RTOS environments.

PTE:: Page Table Entry

PTEP:: Parallel Telemetry Processor, a high- speed virtual processor architecture.

PTG.2:: A physical random number generator class defined in AIS 31 / CC.

PUD:: Patch update?

QEMU:: QEMU (Quick EMUlator) is a free and open-source emulator and virtualizer that can perform hardware virtualization.

Register:: A Register is a group of flip-flops with each flip-flop capable of storing one bit of information. The simplest register is one that consists of only flip-flops with no external gates.

RISC:: Reduced Instruction Set Computer architecture. Information processing using any of a family of microprocessors that are designed to execute computing tasks with the simplest instructions in the shortest amount of time possible. RISC-based machines execute one instruction per clock cycle as opposed to CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) machines that can have special instructions as well as instructions that take more than one cycle to execute.

Rocket:: Parameterized SoC generator written in Chisel, designed to helps tune the design under different performance, power, area constraints, and diverse technology nodes.

RV:: Reliability verification is a category of physical verification that helps ensure the robustness of a design by considering the context of schematic and layout information to perform user-definable checks against various electrical and physical design rules that reduce susceptibility to premature or catastrophic electrical failures, usually over time.

SFENCE:: Orders processor execution relative to all memory stores prior to the SFENCE instruction. The processor ensures that every store prior to SFENCE is globally visible before any store after SFENCE becomes globally visible. The SFENCE instruction is ordered with respect to memory stores, other SFENCE instructions, MFENCE instructions, and any serializing instructions (such as the CPUID instruction). It is not ordered with respect to memory loads or the LFENCE instruction.

SFENCE.VMA:: (instruction wrapper?)

SoC:: System on Chip.

SP 800 90B:: Used in military & USGOV random security evaluations, written by NIST.

SRAM:: Static Random Access Memory

Standard Extension:: mmm

TLB:: Translation Lookaside Buffer; enhances speed in retrieving a value by storing a memory address.

Unpriveleged:: mmm

VM:: Virtual Machine

VMA:: (..Virtual Memory Allocation ??)

XLEN:: Register width--etymology involves reference to mathematical `X` and abbreviation of the word "length."

ZBT:: Zero Bus Turnaround

ZFew:: xxxx
